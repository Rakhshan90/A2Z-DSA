Problem statment: Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.
According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.

/*
Solution 1: Any traversal(inOrder, preOrder, postOrder)
1. Perfrom any traversal to visit each node in the comple binary tree.
2. Every time you you visit a node, increment count by 1.
3. return cnt of nodes.

TC: O(N), SC: O(H)

Solution 2: Property of complete binary tree(Efficient solution)
1. Set a recursive function to calculate the number of nodes.
2. In the recursive function, calculate leftHeight and the right Height of the tree from the given node.
3. If leftHeight == rightHeight, return 2leftHeight â€“ 1.
4. If leftHeight != rightHeight, recursively call the function to calculate nodes in left subtree(leftNodes) and the right subtree(rightNodes) and return 1+leftNodes+rightNodes.
